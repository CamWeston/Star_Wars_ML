This little one isn't worth the effort.  Come ...                              Use the Force, Luke.          You'd better get on with your exercises. Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a m...

Aahhh -- uh huh! C...                         I don't know where he is.                                       That's one.          Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.                                 The Anoat system. Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's tran...

We?                                        Stop what?                                           Whew... Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a p...

They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they? Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us ... That's right, yeah!  I got some old debts I've...                          No reward is worth this.                  Didn't we just leave this party?             But who's going to fly it, kid!  You? You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba....                    There. That looks pretty good.                            Look out!  He's loose!                          Yeah. That'll do nicely.                        This may smell bad, kid...                                  Hey, wait! Ahhh!                              I'm going out there.      It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.                  Don't everyone thank me at once. All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly... We're losing our deflector shield.  Go strap y...            Now let's blow this thing and go home!                                  Wait a minute...                                  What's going on?                               I see it, I see it. Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, w...                                       I'm trying!                 They're not goin' for it, Chewie.                             You're gonna need it.                            Not this ship, sister. Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shiel...       Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.               It's too big to be a space station.                                        Let's see.                  Then I guess I'm getting better.                                             Good.                               You probably don't.                              I did say so before! Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there ar... Not entirely stable?

Tell Jabba...           I have a really bad feeling about this.           She expressed her true feelings for me.                And hope they don't have blasters.                                  What did he say?       I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.        Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.                      Great kid!  Don't get cocky.                   Thank you.

What about that one?                            Hobbie, I've been hit!                                Yoda, I must know.                                      Ben...Ben...                            How did my father die?                      See-Threepio!  See-Threepio!                            Future? Will they die?                             I'll be careful than.                                        I'm sorry. I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on  Tato...          Threepio!  Come in, Threepio!  Threepio! Oh, this little droid!  I think he's searching...        All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru. Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that...            But I can help them! I feel the Force! All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.  Bo...                             What do you remember?                                               No! Well, come on. It's getting late.  I only hope...                                        I'm on it.                  There's something alive in here!                                  Here, hold this.                             But I have no sister.            We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you. These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo an...  I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead. Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but o... Hurry up!  Come with me!  What are you waiting...                             I know what you mean.                 Are you all right?  What's wrong?                        Threepio, we're all right! Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction som...                       Artoo! You be more careful. He says it's the best he can do.  Since the XP...                                             What?       No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?                                  What's in there?                             And I'm stuck here...                                  I've lost Artoo! Just hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire...               Why are we still moving towards it?          I knew you'd come back!  I just knew it!                                     Easy, Chewie.      Join the Rebellion?!  Are you kidding!  How?                                   I know, father.                       I see it, Wedge. Good work.               I saw part of the message he was...                                       She's rich.                                        Never-r-r!                                            Right.                     But I had to help my friends.                                          All set.  But how am I to know the good side from the bad?                    But it's a whole 'nother year.                                    Hear me! Leia!                                   Dagobah system? With the blast shield down, I can't even see. ... Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're luc...            Let's go! And don't forget the droids. Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put...                     Okay.  Han, you put these on.                               Ben is a great man.                                        All right.                           I've got to go to them.                                    Thanks to you.                     Who is she?  She's beautiful.                                    Lock the door! Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've tak... But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. V...                                               No! There are two Banthas down there but I don't s...                                               Ow!                                        Dagobah... Something just moves past my leg!  Look!  Did ...             I have a very bad feeling about this.          Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal.                We're going to the Dagobah system. Now will you move along, little fella? We're g... Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here b... You bet I could.  I'm not such a bad pilot mys...       My scope's negative.  I don't see anything.                     I think we took a wrong turn.                            Yoda spoke of another. The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in th...                      About three or four seasons.                                       Yes, Artoo?                          Yes, that's it. Dagobah.                                            Artoo!                                Are you all right? Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... af...                                           Oh, no!            Well more wealth that you can imagine.               I will. And I'll return. I promise.                Unfortunate that I know the truth?        But there's gotta be something you can do! Sand People!  Or worse!  Come on, let's have a... Yes.  Rich, powerful!  Listen, if you were to ...                            I want to go with you.    Ben?  Ben Kenobi!  Boy, am I glad to see you!                                    Great. Come on. It couldn't happen here.  You said it yourself...                   Han, don't. It'll be all right. ... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.                   I'll see you back at the fleet.                       I must be allowed to speak. Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You...                      Father... I won't leave you. How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sig...          Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch! Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deact...                                      Rouge Three.          This R2 unit has a bad motivator.  Look! That's all right. I'd like to keep it  on manu... I can't keep the vision out of my head. They'r... I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit...             Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner.             Then you know why I have to face him.                                          Got him!                                   Sure, go ahead.     He told me enough! He told me you killed him. I don't know, it just let go of me and disappe... They're going to execute her.  Look, a few min... Yeah, that's what you said last year when Bigg...                                I can't shake him!                   Blast it!  Wedge where are you?                                            Artoo!                 Just hang on. We're almost there. Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up an...               I can't see a thing in this helmet. But I've learned so much since then. Master Yo...                           Get alongside that one!                            Where... where is she?               I won't fail you -- I'm not afraid.                       I can't kill my own father. Well, things haven't been the same since you l... Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wi...                            Is the ship all right?                         And you will be rewarded. Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be r... Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.  We're going ...                                           Oh, no! Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've go...                              I'll never join you! Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight.                                           Thanks.                Artoo, try and increase the power!                                   Okay, let's go. It looks like I'm going nowhere.  I have to fi...                                           Good...                               Luke, what's wrong?            Keep on that one! I'll take these two! So... you got your reward and you're just leav...                           Leia! Leia's my sister.                                        Just Luke.        Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners. There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear...           You don't believe in the Force, do you?                             What a piece of junk.                                   Anywhere!  Oh!! Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteori...                                  What's going on?        I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.                                           Father.                 ... oh-five; we'll cover for you. It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm ...                                     You know him!             Mostly because of my father, I guess.       Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now!                You'll find I'm full of surprises. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the deten...                  Where are you going?  Come back! H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small...                   What do you mean?  Where is it? Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the g...   Quietly, there might be more of them out there.             But Han and Leia will die if I don't.                                       It's Vader.            I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.       No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!               I didn't hear you give any ideas...                             The walls are moving!                       What are you talking about?                 There's something not right here.                                   He's my father.                            That's it!  We did it! Biggs!  Of course, I'll be up there with you! ... Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that...                         Uh, you can call me Luke.                                       What is it?                                    Thanks, Wedge.                                   It followed us!              Chewie, take care of yourself, okay? You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to...       We're not going to regroup with the others.                                        Ben...Ben.                        What's wrong with him now?                                   There they are!            I found out Darth Vader was my father. Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder....                                       What?  How?                           I'm on my way in now...                       And sacrifice Han and Leia? I didn't know you were back!  When did you get... I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I...           Sure, there're more than enough droids.                     I will not fight you, father.     Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.                  That oughta hold it for a while.                             Vader's on that ship.        Okay.  Now, I'm going to put these on you.                            I can't. It's too big.                Then the droid does belong to you.                        I only wish Ben were here. No, my father didn't fight in the wars.  He wa...                          You want the impossible. But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up ... No, I'm not going to change my mind about this...                      Ben, why didn't you tell me?                         But I've learned so much.             That armor's too strong for blasters.                  Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? Do you really think we're going to find a pilo... I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warr...        Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.               Just like new, Dack. How about you? Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  Y...                                 Steady, Rouge Two                    There isn't any other way out.                             Artoo! Where are you? You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before,...                                            Hello.                                           I will.                     You fought in the Clone Wars?                     Why didn't you say so before?                                         Oh, Leia. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  Yo...                         All right, I'm coming in.                       Oh, Artoo, let him have it.                        Thank you, sir.  I'll try.

Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.                   Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.                                   Oh, switch off. Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. I...
