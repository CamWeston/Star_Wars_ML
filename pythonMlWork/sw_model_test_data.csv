Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you...                   You cannot escape your destiny. If you choose to face Vader, you will do it al...

There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Maste... Well of course, of course I know him.  He's me...                        That boy is our last hope.                  Don't worry, he'll be all right.                        That's your uncle talking.                     So was I, if you'll remember.                  Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

I saw them! No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit nea...                       I thought she was with you.                                       I love you. I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pret...                    That's two you owe me, junior. Transport, this is Solo. Better take off -- I ...           That's right. And my friends out in it.           I've got a very bad feeling about this.       Good morning. Nice of you guys to  drop by.                                             Yeah. It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's kee...              Yeah, but this time I got the money.                                        I'm sorry.                           Can't get out that way.

Good, I hate long waits.                      Chewie? Chewie, is that you? You. Listen to you -- you sound like a busines... Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way ...                    Get behind me!  Get behind me! It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Ch...                       Chewie, get us out of here! Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it  off! T... Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the subl...                       What, Chewie? What? Chewie!       No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando. Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can f...                          That's your imagination. Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But, ...                                       Sure, Leia. Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?  You know, som...                                            Where?     Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.         All right, Chewie, let's get out of here! Seventeen thousand!  Those guys must really be...                                          Why not?         I can't hold them off forever!  Now what?          Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey!                Well, look at you, a general, huh?                                        Hey!  Hey!                        Well, what would you like?                      Here's where the fun begins! Save your strength. There'll be another time. ... Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I ...                         Yeah, you're a real hero.         Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?                                       Be careful. Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy...                        Then I'll see you in hell!                              Where are you going?                                      Over to you?  Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!           Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.                                 What do you want?                                  Turn her around.                Don't worry, she'll hold together.                                 We're in trouble! We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboa...                                         You, too. Still, she's got a lot of spirit.  I don't kno... It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's...                          Boy you said it, Chewie.                                             Luke?"
2,LANDO,"                                    Hold it! Whoa!                               That was too close. So you see, since we're a small operation, we ... Split up and head back to the surface. See if ... How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see ... We've got to be able to get some kind of a rea... Only the fighters are attacking.  I wonder wha... Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'l...                                             What?          Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!     Break off the attack! The shield is still up.                      All right, Chewie. Let's go.                    Everyone's invited, of course.                              All wings report in.                                         Lower it!"
3,LEIA,"         And what precisely am I supposed to know?                                   I'll cover you.    Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.                   We don't need any of your help.        I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.                                           Thanks. We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret ...                          Then I'm going with you. This is some rescue.  When you came in here, d... Somebody has to save our skins.  Into the garb...                                       Cut it out!                                             What?                                          Mynocks?          You don't have to do this to impress me. Occasionally  maybe...when you aren't  acting ...          So you're part of the mining guild then? The sooner the better. Something's wrong here....                 Ben Kenobi is here!  Where is he?                                     I don't know.                  Just...images, really. Feelings.             You certainly have a way with people.                                   Are you crazy?!                                              Yes.                                   What about Han?                  I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee. He's got to follow his own path.  No one can c... Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with...                                       Not really.          With the rest of the garbage. Then what? Quick, we've got to get across.  Find the cont...                  Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this. That doesn't sound too hard.  Besides, they le...                                     I'll be back."

Ben?                                 We got separated.   Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.                             I will not fight you. Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought ...                           I see them. Wait, Leia!                                          Get him!                                 Wouldn't miss it.                              Got him!  I got him!                           No sign of any... wait! Master, moving stones around is one thing.

Well, I'm sorry.                                         You, too. Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up ...                           Well, let's get moving!

We're going, we're going.                                        You won't.                    Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in. Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scan... Why don't you outrun them?  I thought you said... How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to ...             Blast it, will you!  My gun's jammed.                               Yeah, take it away.                                Artoo -- that way!                  All right, boys, keep tight now.                                          Come on! But I need your help.
