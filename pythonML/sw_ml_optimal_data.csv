character,dialogue
YODA,"I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak.  When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?"
LANDO,Han! Chewie?
LUKE,Stay tight and low.
LANDO,"We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!"
HAN,"I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.  Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right."
HAN,Wonderful girl!  Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.  Get in there!
YODA,No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.
LUKE,Ask me again sometime.
LANDO,Leia! Go!
BEN,"Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet."
HAN,Stay back.
LEIA,"And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?"
THREEPIO,"Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!"
YODA,No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
LEIA,If your people fixed the hyperdrive.
HAN,"Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of  the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables."
THREEPIO,"... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh!"
LUKE,Uncle Owen...
THREEPIO,"Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid  field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one."
LUKE,Yeah.
LUKE,They're coming in too fast!
LUKE,"Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?"
LANDO,"Look, someone's up there."
LUKE,Help!
YODA,"Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have."
LUKE,Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff.
YODA,"Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of  the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice."
LUKE,You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.
THREEPIO,Help!  I think I'm melting!This is all your fault.
HAN,"Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it."
THREEPIO,He agrees!
LUKE,You will take me to Jabba now!
LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope."
LUKE,"Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
HAN,Move! Move!
LUKE,I'm looking for someone.
LUKE,The princess?  She's here?
HAN,"Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?"
LANDO,Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
LUKE,He's going to pull us all apart.
THREEPIO,"Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me."
YODA,Your weapons...you will not need them.
LEIA,"No, you're not. You're..."
LANDO,"All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower."
LEIA,I am not a committee!
THREEPIO,"We found the computer outlet, sir."
LEIA,"Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away."
LANDO,What are you doing here?
HAN,No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh -- uh huh! Come on.
HAN,I don't know where he is.
LANDO,Well done. Hold them in the security tower -- and keep it  quiet. Move.
LEIA,I...
LEIA,It could be worse...
VADER,No. I am your father.
THREEPIO,They did it!
LUKE,"Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make  this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass."
THREEPIO,Artoo-Detoo!  It's you!  It's you!
HAN,That's one.
LUKE,"See-Threepio, do you copy?"
HAN,"Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando."
LEIA,Shut up!
HAN,The Anoat system.
HAN,Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.
HAN,I can't see.
VADER,Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison  here.
THREEPIO,"Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this."
HAN,Sshh!
LANDO,You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.
LEIA,"Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?"
THREEPIO,"Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness."
LANDO,We're on our way.
BEN,"Learn about the Force, Luke."
HAN,"General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore."
HAN,We?
LANDO,Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie  over to me.
HAN,Stop what?
LEIA,It's not bad.
LUKE,"Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!"
THREEPIO,"Oh, switch off."
YODA,"Oh, you will be. You will be."
YODA,Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.
THREEPIO,"Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!!"
HAN,Whew...
VADER,Impressive...most impressive.
LUKE,"No, Threepio's with them."
HAN,"Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident!"
HAN,You all right?
LANDO,All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
LUKE,I must speak with Jabba.
LANDO,I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.
THREEPIO,There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke.
BEN,Yoda will always be with you.
LUKE,I wish I'd known him.
LANDO,"Well, he's on his way."
THREEPIO,"Over here!  Help!  Please, help!"
HAN,I think we're in trouble.
HAN,Yahoo!
VADER,I'll take them myself!  Cover me!
THREEPIO,"Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt."
HAN,I feel terrible.
LEIA,"He means ""You're welcome."""
YODA,"No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive."
HAN,"They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?"
THREEPIO,There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.
LUKE,I care!
THREEPIO,"Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!"
THREEPIO,Where are you going?
THREEPIO,He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.
LEIA,"But, why must you confront him?"
THREEPIO,"But Master Luke, what magic? couldn't possibly --"
LUKE,Come with me.
LUKE,"You know, I did feel something.  I could almost see the remote."
THREEPIO,Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop!
LUKE,Coming in point three five.
LUKE,around forever trying to find them.
HAN,"Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south  passage."
THREEPIO,"No, I don't like you either."
LUKE,You can't do any more good back there!
BEN,"I suggest you try it again, Luke."
VADER,You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I  have Skywalker.
LEIA,"Luke! Luke, don't -- it's a trap! It's a trap!"
LUKE,"Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get  the smaller modules on the transports."
THREEPIO,"Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir."
VADER,"Apology accepted, Captain Needa."
HAN,"That's right, yeah!  I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.  Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you?  Why don't you come with us?  You're pretty good in a fight.  I could use you."
THREEPIO,I'm going to regret this.
LUKE,"You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here."
LUKE,"I understand.  Artoo, fire up the  converters."
HAN,No reward is worth this.
LUKE,What's this?
HAN,Didn't we just leave this party?
THREEPIO,He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here.  He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.
HAN,"But who's going to fly it, kid!  You?"
LEIA,Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
HAN,"You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time."
THREEPIO,"Oh, Artoo, hurry!"
HAN,There. That looks pretty good.
HAN,Look out!  He's loose!
LUKE,Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
VADER,Obi-Wan is here.  The Force is with him.
LUKE,But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
THREEPIO,"Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that."
LUKE,"Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm  ready."
HAN,Yeah. That'll do nicely.
THREEPIO,"Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This  signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code."
LUKE,He'll be all right.
LEIA,Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
LEIA,Why are you still here?
LUKE,"Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers."
BEN,"Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him."
HAN,"This may smell bad, kid..."
HAN,"Hey, wait! Ahhh!"
HAN,I'm going out there.
THREEPIO,Good morning.
LEIA,Send all troops in sector twelve to the south  slope to protect the fighters.
BEN,Your eyes can deceive you.  Don't trust them.
LEIA,"Let go, please."
LUKE,Is there more to this recording?
LEIA,I'm trying!
HAN,It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.
YODA,Your father he is.
HAN,Don't everyone thank me at once.
LANDO,What have you done to my ship?
HAN,"All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie."
HAN,"We're losing our deflector shield.  Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed."
THREEPIO,"Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose."
LUKE,"You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen."
THREEPIO,What makes you think there are settlements over there?
HAN,Now let's blow this thing and go home!
YODA,"You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses  the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack."
THREEPIO,"Oh, no! Chewbacca!"
THREEPIO,Princess Leia.
HAN,Wait a minute...
VADER,Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
THREEPIO,"But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid."
VADER,As you wish.
LEIA,I love you!
LUKE,I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
LEIA,"Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down."
HAN,What's going on?
HAN,"I see it, I see it."
HAN,"Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea."
LEIA,"General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope."
LUKE,"Oh, no!  We've got to do something."
LEIA,to take the responsibility yourself!
THREEPIO,"Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!"
THREEPIO,"Wait, what's that?  A transport!  I'm saved!"
LUKE,I don't...I don't believe it.
LUKE,"Good luck, Lando"
THREEPIO,"Well, he seems very friendly."
LUKE,I wonder who she is.  It sounds like she's in trouble.  I'd better play back the whole thing.
LUKE,I can't get involved!  I've got work to do!  It's not that I like the Empire.  I hate it!  But there's nothing I can do about it right now.  It's such a long way from here.
LEIA,"No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you."
THREEPIO,"Master Luke, sir!  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?"
LUKE,"Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life.  With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids."
LUKE,We've been cut off!  Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that?  I didn't copy!
THREEPIO,"If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop."
VADER,The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
LUKE,"I got a little cooked, but I'm okay."
THREEPIO,Secret mission?  What plans?  What are you talking about?  I'm not getting in there!
HAN,I'm trying!
LUKE,I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.
LANDO,Good luck.
LANDO,"You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things."
LUKE,"That's right, Artoo. We're going to the  Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep...  to an old friend."
BEN,You don't need to see his identification.
HAN,"They're not goin' for it, Chewie."
THREEPIO,Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...
LEIA,Why are they doing this?
HAN,You're gonna need it.
LUKE,"Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?"
HAN,"Not this ship, sister."
LUKE,Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
HAN,Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
HAN,"Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing."
LUKE,He knew my father?
LEIA,I'm not trembling.
HAN,It's too big to be a space station.
LUKE,Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
HAN,Let's see.
HAN,Then I guess I'm getting better.
VADER,Where is that shuttle going?
VADER,"They are clear, my Master."
LUKE,Vader. Is the dark side stronger?
BEN,"This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct."
LUKE,Your overconfidence is your weakness.
LEIA,How do you know?
HAN,Good.
HAN,You probably don't.
LUKE,Uncle Owen...
LUKE,"Take care, you two. May the Force be with you."
BEN,"Let go, Luke."
HAN,I did say so before!
LEIA,"The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any  enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood?"
HAN,Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.
THREEPIO,I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!
VADER,As you wish.
LUKE,We're all right.  You did great.
LEIA,"Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?"
LEIA,"All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The  heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports."
THREEPIO,That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if...
LUKE,I want to come with you to Alderaan.  There's nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
THREEPIO,We surrender.
HAN,"Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these  things.  Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive."
LUKE,How's that.
HAN,"No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie."
HAN,What kept you?
LEIA,"But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free."
THREEPIO,"... and a gift.  Gift, what gift?"
HAN,"See? My friend.  Keep your eyes open, okay?"
HAN,"Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie."
YODA,Will he finished what he begins?
LUKE,Then I am a Jedi?
LUKE,Tell me.
LUKE,Come on!
THREEPIO,"Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?"
THREEPIO,I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...
HAN,I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front  shield.
HAN,"Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power."
HAN,"Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?"
VADER,He will not be permanently damaged.
HAN,Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
LUKE,"Thanks, Threepio."
HAN,This is not going to work.
THREEPIO,"I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to..."
LANDO,Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
VADER,We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.  Get the crews to their fighters.
HAN,Luke!  Luke!  Luke!
HAN,"He's the brains, sweetheart."
VADER,"Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me."
LUKE,"All right, come on!  And the red one, come on.  Well, come on, Red, let's go."
THREEPIO,"Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more  direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for."
VADER,Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a  clear transmission.
THREEPIO,"He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording."
HAN,Now's our chance!  Go!
THREEPIO,"Rather touchy, aren't they?"
BEN,"Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor."
LUKE,"No, you don't. You've always been strong."
HAN,There aren't any bases around here.  Where did it come from?
HAN,"Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie."
HAN,Come on!
LUKE,"Get clear, Wedge."
HAN,I'm a nice man.
THREEPIO,Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo!
HAN,It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.
LUKE,... Threepio!
LEIA,I happen to like nice men.
HAN,"Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them."
LANDO,Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers.
LUKE,I'll meet you back at the fleet.
THREEPIO,"You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just..."
HAN,Get to the top!
LUKE,The same as always.
LANDO,I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry.
LUKE,"Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or..."
VADER,A tremor in the Force.  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
LUKE,What? She didn't come back?
LUKE,It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home.
HAN,Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us  out of here and you pull both of these.
HAN,Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three!
LUKE,"If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to  agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy."
LUKE,"Artoo, see what you can do with it.  Hang on back there."
THREEPIO,Wake up!  Wake up!
THREEPIO,Because he's holding a thermal detonator.
THREEPIO,"Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god."
THREEPIO,"Well, I'm not going that way.  It's much too rocky.  This way is much easier."
LEIA,What happened?
VADER,"Don't fail me again, Admiral."
THREEPIO,"He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric."
THREEPIO,"Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place."
HAN,Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
LUKE,"Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?"
THREEPIO,"Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do."
HAN,"Seems okay, if we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission."
LEIA,I know. Somehow...I've always known.
BEN,"Yes, indeed.  If it's a fast ship."
HAN,Transmission commencing.
LUKE,You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
VADER,"Yes, my Master."
THREEPIO,"They're madmen!  They're heading for the prison level.  If you hurry, you might catch them."
HAN,Princess?  What's going on?
LUKE,No! No! No!
YODA,"Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through  the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone."
YODA,Mmm. Friends you have there.
HAN,Nice!  Come on!
LUKE,"It sure is leaving in a big hurry.  If they identify us, we're in big trouble."
LEIA,What is it?
THREEPIO,"This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message."
HAN,"Yeah, me too."
THREEPIO,Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.
HAN,Shut him up or shut him down!  Check the  deflector shield!
VADER,Stay in attack formation!
HAN,Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave  without giving you a goodbye kiss?
THREEPIO,Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.
YODA,"And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a  powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we......not this crude matter.  You must feel the Force around you.  Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!"
HAN,Punch it!
LUKE,No!
LUKE,"I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't  see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle..."
THREEPIO,I've got to rest before I fall apart.  My joints are almost frozen. 
THREEPIO,"I am See-Threepio, human-cy..."
VADER,I find your lack of faith disturbing.
LUKE,"Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message."
LUKE,There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.
LANDO,I'm just trying to help...
HAN,Thank you.
LUKE,"Chewie, give 'em your crossbow."
VADER,They have just made the jump into hyperspace.
HAN,It might.
HAN,"Lando, grab it!"
THREEPIO,Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the  thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know.
HAN,Over my dead body.
LANDO,I promised to return his ship without a scratch...I sure hope that old pirate forgives me.
LEIA,He certainly has courage.
LUKE,A certain point of view!
LEIA,"I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain."
THREEPIO,"Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back."
LUKE,What?  Oh... the uniform.  I'm Luke Skywalker.  I'm here to rescue you. 
THREEPIO,"Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?"
THREEPIO,"You must repair him!  Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them."
LUKE,"Vader is here...now, on this moon."
LUKE,"I can't do it, Ben."
YODA,No. There is another.
VADER,"...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds  the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations."
HAN,"Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!"
YODA,Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
HAN,Thank you.
LUKE,Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...
HAN,"Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much."
YODA,So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you  nothing that I say?
BEN,"When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan."
VADER,I have felt it.
HAN,Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it.
VADER,"And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base."
LANDO,"Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down."
HAN,What's going on...buddy?
THREEPIO,"Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He  hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is."
VADER,"It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now."
HAN,"Back door, huh? Good idea."
BEN,Leave that to me!
HAN,Good luck.
HAN,"Hey, I don't get it."
HAN,Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.
LANDO,Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.
BEN,It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.
LUKE,Just tell them.
HAN,"That bad, huh? Where's Leia?"
THREEPIO,"Thank goodness, they haven't found them!  Where could they be?"
VADER,That name no longer has any meaning for me.
HAN,"Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness."
LUKE,"Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.  He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi."
LEIA,"My...! Why, you stuck up,...half-witted,...scruffy-looking...  nerf-herder!"
LUKE,Artoo?
LUKE,I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
LEIA,"Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board."
LEIA,Would you please stop calling me that?
LUKE,No... of course not.
LEIA,Your friend is quite a mercenary.  I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.
THREEPIO,Do you think they'll melt us down?
HAN,We're caught in a tractor beam!  It's pulling us in!
HAN,"I'm trying not to, kid!"
HAN,It'll work. It'll work.
BEN,"And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear."
THREEPIO,"Oh. Well, yes."
LUKE,"Go on, go on.  I can't understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead."
THREEPIO,I knew all along it had to be a mistake.
BEN,Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
BEN,"Be patient, Luke.  Stay and watch over the droids."
HAN,"I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio."
LUKE,"No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around."
THREEPIO,"Artoo expresses his relief, also."
BEN,"I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. "
THREEPIO,But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!!
BEN,"But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when  you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force."
LEIA,That's all any of us can see.
LUKE,Look!
HAN,Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
HAN,Hey... it's me.
LUKE,I can't believe he's gone.
LEIA,Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...
THREEPIO,"But, sir!"
BEN,No.  It's a short range fighter.
THREEPIO,We're doomed!
VADER,What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
LUKE,I saw...I saw a city in the clouds.
LUKE,I almost forgot.  There's a battle going on!  Right here in our system.  Come and look!
LUKE,"It looks like Sand People did this, all right.  Look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.  It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before."
HAN,There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a  space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back.
LUKE,I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
HAN,"Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid."
HAN,Come on.
HAN,Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a  burnout.
LUKE,I wish I was going...  Are you going to be around long? 
BEN,"A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force."
BEN,You don't know that.
HAN,"Hi, kid.  There's got to be a reason for it. Check it  at the other end. Wait a second.  You all right?"
LEIA,No light-speed?
THREEPIO,"Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble.  It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master."
THREEPIO,"Deactivate!  Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt..."
BEN,"Luke, don't give in to hate -- that leads to the dark side."
HAN,"Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else."
THREEPIO,"Oh, my.  I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel."
HAN,Get in there you big furry oaf!  I don't care what you smell!  Get in there and don't worry about it.
LUKE,"Where could he be?  Threepio!  Threepio, will you come in?"
LUKE,"Well, I didn't..."
LUKE,Do you understand anything they're saying?
LUKE,Like we're being watched!
BEN,You will go to the Dagobah system.
VADER,The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!
LEIA,I wonder who they found to pull that off.
HAN,"All right, hang on."
LUKE,Then I guess I won't see you.
LEIA,"Han, we need you!"
LEIA,"Hey, are you awake?"
LUKE,I'm ready for anything.
THREEPIO,How rude!
HAN,I'm not going to argue with that.
HAN,Then we'll do it real quiet-like.
BEN,I don't think you boys can help.  I must go alone.
BEN,That's no moon!  It's a space station.
LUKE,"Oh, I think I just blasted it."
VADER,I'm on the leader.
HAN,"Well, of course I'll have to replace it."
THREEPIO,Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed?
LUKE,This is Red Five!  I'm going in!
VADER,The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel  came out of light-speed too close to the system.
LUKE,"I'm hit, but not bad."
LUKE,"Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you  read me?"
HAN,"I'm okay, pal."
LUKE,It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.
THREEPIO,"Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you  on the communicator."
LUKE,But they're going to kill her!
HAN,Doesn't sound so bad.
LUKE,What happened?
HAN,"Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!"
HAN,Ah! Chew--Chewie!
HAN,Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this.
LEIA,I'm here.
LUKE,Then my father is truly dead.
THREEPIO,How typical.
BEN,Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.  Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.
LUKE,"Artoo... that, that stabilizer's broken loose again!  See if you can't lock it down!"
THREEPIO,What did he say?
VADER,We would be honored if you would join us.
LUKE,"Well, who... who has he found?"
THREEPIO,"Hello, sir."
VADER,"Son, come with me."
HAN,"Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward."
BEN,"To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!"
THREEPIO,"Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling."
VADER,Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.  It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.
LEIA,Star Destroyer.
LANDO,The security codes has been changed!
LUKE,No!  wait!
LUKE,"Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we?"
THREEPIO,Hurry!
HAN,Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.
HAN,There she is.
VADER,"Yes, my Master."
LUKE,"So... what do you think of her, Han?"
LUKE,"Rouge Two, are you all right?"
LUKE,What is it?
HAN,How are we doing?
LUKE,They were in pain.
LEIA,Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust  you?
THREEPIO,"Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After  all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most..."
LEIA,I gotta get you out of here.
BEN,I think we better get indoors.  The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.
BEN,"Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father."
LEIA,"We don't have time for our sorrows, commander.  The battle station has surely tracked us here.It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.  You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack.  It is our only hope."
LUKE,"If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.  And that would lead them back home!"
VADER,Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.
THREEPIO,"Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional  again."
LEIA,A mining colony?
LUKE,Yes.
VADER,"You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule."
LUKE,"I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.  He needs me for just one more season.  I can't leave him now."
THREEPIO,It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
LUKE,Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.
VADER,I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.
YODA,"Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will."
HAN,"Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess."
VADER,I have traced the Rebel spies to her.  Now she is my only link to find their secret base!
THREEPIO,"Well, they did let us land."
LUKE,You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
HAN,Luke! Luke!
LANDO,"Princess, we'll find Han. I promise."
YODA,"Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse."
THREEPIO,Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.
HAN,"I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps.  If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself."
LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You'remy only hope."
BEN,That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.
BEN,I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
HAN,Where did you dig up that old fossil?
THREEPIO,Yes sir?
THREEPIO,"Oh, he excels at that, sir."
THREEPIO,Sounds dangerous.
VADER,"Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is  your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way."
HAN,"You're all clear, kid."
HAN,What're you lookin' at?  I know what I'm doing.
LUKE,Ben. Leia!
LUKE,Maybe they know what happened.
LUKE,It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.
BEN,You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
THREEPIO,No more adventures.  I'm not going that way.
THREEPIO,"Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo."
LUKE,You'll get it!
THREEPIO,"Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?"
BEN,The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.  You will find it a powerful ally.
YODA,It is the future you see.
HAN,Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
LUKE,"Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something..."
LUKE,Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel  like...I don't know...
BEN,A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
HAN,"Why, you--"
LEIA,I thought you knew this person.
HAN,Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.
VADER,"Yes, Admiral?"
HAN,"I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?"
HAN,It looks like an Imperial cruiser.  Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.  Try and hold them off.  Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.
LANDO,Will you join me for a little refreshment?
HAN,No. No problem. Why?
HAN,One thing's for sure.  We're all going to be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!
LUKE,"All right, I'll give it a try."
HAN,Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.
HAN,Don't get excited.
HAN,Blast the door!  Kid!
LUKE,"Hi, Han... Chewie."
HAN,Lando...
HAN,Oh... great!
LUKE,The Force?
LEIA,Lando.
THREEPIO,"Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?"
LUKE,Move closer!
VADER,"He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops  for a surface attack."
THREEPIO,"Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up  any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope."
LEIA,I thought you decided to stay.
LUKE,"Master Yoda, you can't die."
HAN,Luke.
THREEPIO,I can't abide these Jawas.  Disgusting creatures.
LUKE,"Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments."
LUKE,No!
BEN,Ninety-four.
HAN,"Chewie, you okay? Where is he?"
VADER,Several fighters have broken off from the main group.  Come with me!
LEIA,I don't trust Lando.
LUKE,You will...
LUKE,"Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go  for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them.  All right, stand by, Dack."
THREEPIO,I have decided that we shall stay here.
LUKE,"I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go.  As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.  I have to face him."
HAN,Oh yeah? Watch this.
LUKE,Have you been in many battles?
LUKE,"You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make."
LEIA,Afraid?
HAN,"Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one."
LANDO,"Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab."
LUKE,"Hey, we better go look for her."
LEIA,Why?
VADER,My son is with them.
HAN,They never even asked me any questions.
HAN,Lando's got people who can fix him.
LUKE,It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.
HAN,"I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!"
HAN,Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.
LUKE,Point it at the deck!
THREEPIO,What a desolate place this is.
BEN,Patience.
LUKE,But tell me why I can't...
LUKE,Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
THREEPIO,been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! 
THREEPIO,"Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die."
LEIA,For luck!
LUKE,You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.
HAN,There's another ship coming in.
LUKE,"I feel cold, death."
HAN,Afraid there's not much left.
THREEPIO,Pulverized?
VADER,No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.
LUKE,Han! Leia!
HAN,Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
HAN,Bring me the hydrospanners!
LUKE,"Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me."
THREEPIO,"I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter."
HAN,I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.
LANDO,I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?
LANDO,H-a-a-a...
BEN,Luke...Luke.
BEN,Was I any different when you taught me?
YODA,That is why you fail.
LEIA,An Imperial probe droid.
HAN,Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.
THREEPIO,He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.
VADER,The Force is strong with this one!
THREEPIO,"Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast."
LUKE,"Yeah, she's comin' up."
LEIA,Thank you.
LANDO,Lord Vader has set a trap for him.
LUKE,But there was a lot of firing earlier...
HAN,You got her warmed?
LUKE,Who do you think...
LUKE,You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
LANDO,Chewie!
HAN,Rich?
HAN,"Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that I've got his money."
THREEPIO,"Now be careful, Artoo."
THREEPIO,"Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My  facilities are at your..."
LEIA,Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.
LEIA,At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
LUKE,"But he didn't know she was here.  Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?"
HAN,Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?
THREEPIO,"If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this  ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish."
BEN,"Remember, the Force will be with you... always."
HAN,"Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card  player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him."
THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-..."
LUKE,I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
LUKE,Nothing.  I'm all right.
VADER,"Yes, my master."
HAN,Yeah.
VADER,Commence primary ignition.
LUKE,"You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it."
HAN,Luke! Where's Leia?
LUKE,Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even  exists.
HAN,"Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one."
HAN,"No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that."
LUKE,Threepio!  Come in Threepio!  Threepio!  Where could he be?
VADER,"You cannot hide forever, Luke."
LEIA,Lando?
HAN,Deck Officer. Deck Officer!
HAN,"Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance."
YODA,Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things ... the way of the Force.
HAN,Oww! Chewie!
LUKE,What about that one?
LUKE,"Hobbie, I've been hit!"
THREEPIO,Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  Will this never end?
LUKE,"Yoda, I must know."
HAN,What the hell are you doing?
LUKE,Ben...Ben...
LUKE,How did my father die?
THREEPIO,At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.
HAN,Come on! Come on!
LEIA,What looks pretty good?
BEN,"In my experience, there's no such thing as luck."
VADER,That's it. The  Rebels are there.
LUKE,See-Threepio!  See-Threepio!
LUKE,Future? Will they die?
HAN,"No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.  You'll know if anything comes around."
LUKE,I'll be careful than.
BEN,"Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things.  It surrounds us and penetrates us.  It binds the galaxy together."
HAN,"Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours."
LUKE,I'm sorry.
THREEPIO,"Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.  He really is in first-class condition.  I've worked with him before.  Here he comes."
HAN,"What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage.  It's more like suicide."
THREEPIO,"Oh, dear."
HAN,"Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square."
BEN,They're for sale if you want them.
LUKE,I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on  Tatooine.
LUKE,"Threepio!  Come in, Threepio!  Threepio!"
LUKE,"Oh, this little droid!  I think he's searching for his former master...  I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems tobe no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours?  Do you know who he's talking about?"
HAN,What?
LUKE,"All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru."
LUKE,"Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we  could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just..."
LEIA,Han!
LANDO,We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
LUKE,But I can help them! I feel the Force!
HAN,Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.
LUKE,"All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.  Boy, am I gonna get it."
LUKE,What do you remember?
YODA,"No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I  teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm."
HAN,Sorry about the mess.
LEIA,"Lord Vader, I should have known.  Only you could be so bold.  The Imperial Senate will not sit stillfor this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic..."
THREEPIO,"Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!"
HAN,Throw me another charge.
LUKE,No!
THREEPIO,"What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see.  Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected -- if he survives the freezing process, that is."
HAN,Here! And Chewie...
LANDO,No.
VADER,Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along  their last know trajectory.
LUKE,"Well, come on. It's getting late.  I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up."
LUKE,I'm on it.
LEIA,There's no lock!
LUKE,There's something alive in here!
VADER,"Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador.  I want her alive!"
LUKE,"Here, hold this."
THREEPIO,"Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke  again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see.  Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right."
HAN,Chewie!
BEN,Anakin was a good friend.
HAN,Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!
THREEPIO,"It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission."
LUKE,But I have no sister.
LUKE,We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you.
YODA,"Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control."
THREEPIO,I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
LUKE,These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.
THREEPIO,"Hello? How interesting. Oh, my."
LEIA,"Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have."
LUKE,I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.
THREEPIO,"I see, sir."
LUKE,"Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit."
VADER,"Don't play games with me, Your Highness.  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you."
HAN,The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand  by the manual release for the landing claw.
BEN,The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
LUKE,Hurry up!  Come with me!  What are you waiting for?!  Get in gear!
HAN,Where am I?
LUKE,I know what you mean.
LUKE,Are you all right?  What's wrong?
LEIA,I need? I don't know what you're talking about.
THREEPIO,It can wait.
LEIA,Stop that! My hands are dirty.
THREEPIO,"Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!"
HAN,Just what I always wanted.
HAN,"Hang on, kid."
LEIA,"The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.  It's not over yet!"
YODA,"Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi  Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil."
HAN,Not much time.
THREEPIO,"I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?"
LUKE,"Threepio, we're all right!"
HAN,"I'm all right, pal. I'm all right."
LUKE,"Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well."
LUKE,Artoo! You be more careful.
BEN,This little one isn't worth the effort.  Come let me buy you something...
BEN,"Use the Force, Luke."
LUKE,"He says it's the best he can do.  Since the XP-38 came out, they "
VADER,I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on  Captain Solo.
LANDO,"Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation."
HAN,"Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?"
HAN,Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.
VADER,Don't underestimate the Force.
THREEPIO,That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times. 
HAN,It's not my fault.
LUKE,What?
HAN,I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power  systems.
LANDO,"Look, would you get going, you pirate."
VADER,He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
HAN,"You hear me, baby?  Hold together!"
HAN,I'm not the type to run.
LEIA,What was it?
THREEPIO,"Oh, you did it!"
HAN,"Oh, what about you need?"
VADER,Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
LUKE,"No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?"
VADER,"Your powers are weak, old man."
LUKE,What's in there?
HAN,"Yeah, sure."
LUKE,And I'm stuck here...
HAN,Prepare to make the jump to light-speed.
LANDO,"Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later."
LEIA,Your father?
THREEPIO,"For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship."
HAN,Horizontal boosters...!
HAN,"Get out of here, Lando!"
THREEPIO,"I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily..."
LUKE,I've lost Artoo!
LEIA,Grab him!
THREEPIO,"I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on."
HAN,"Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back."
LUKE,"Just hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable."
HAN,"Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us."
VADER,Let him go!  Stay on the leader!
LUKE,Why are we still moving towards it?
HAN,"Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us."
LANDO,They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not  my fault!
VADER,All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor  thought.
HAN,Oh!  The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you've discovered!  Let's get out of here!  Get away from there...
BEN,You'd better get on with your exercises.
BEN,Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.
LEIA,What did you have in mind for your next move?
LUKE,I knew you'd come back!  I just knew it!
LUKE,"Easy, Chewie."
LUKE,Join the Rebellion?!  Are you kidding!  How?
LUKE,"I know, father."
LANDO,"Okay, let's go."
LEIA,"Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you?"
LUKE,"I see it, Wedge. Good work."
HAN,Not for long...
HAN,"Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?"
THREEPIO,"I see, sir Luke."
HAN,"Come on, Chewie!"
LUKE,I saw part of the message he was...
LUKE,She's rich.
HAN,"Loud and clear, kid. What's up?"
THREEPIO,"Come along, Artoo."
BEN,"Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous."
LUKE,Never-r-r!
LUKE,Right.
HAN,I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!
HAN,I better!
THREEPIO,Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?
THREEPIO,Are you sure this things safe?
LUKE,But I had to help my friends.
LUKE,All set.
LANDO,"You won't get another chance at this, Admiral."
HAN,"There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.  I'm in full power.  I'm going to have to shut down.  But they're not going to get me without a fight!"
VADER,He will come to me?
HAN,"Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?   My friend!"
LUKE,But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
LEIA,There wasn't anything you could have done.
THREEPIO,Is there anything I might do to help? 
LUKE,But it's a whole 'nother year.
LUKE,Hear me! Leia!
THREEPIO,"What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!"
YODA,Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
LUKE,Dagobah system?
THREEPIO,"Use the comlink?  Oh, my!  I forgot I turned it off!"
LEIA,What is it?
LANDO,"All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?"
VADER,"Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and  deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett."
HAN,I'm not going anywhere.
THREEPIO,The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.  A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
HAN,You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough  scoundrels in your life.
LEIA,Watch what?
HAN,Whatever you say.  I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.
YODA,"He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training."
LUKE,"With the blast shield down, I can't even see.  How am I supposed to fight?"
HAN,What's your plan?
VADER,"Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for..."
HAN,"Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?"
HAN,Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
LANDO,"Come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball."
THREEPIO,"Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite."
LUKE,"Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste  very good. Anything broken?"
LUKE,Let's go! And don't forget the droids.
HAN,"Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach."
LANDO,"Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for."
THREEPIO,"You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more  we can do. And my joints are freezing up."
LANDO,"Welcome, Leia."
LUKE,Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there.  There you go.
VADER,Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
THREEPIO,"I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.  The main entrance seems to be the only way out; all other information on your level is restricted."
LEIA,Luke!
THREEPIO,I heartily agree with you sir.
HAN,Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this  little operation and shut you down?
THREEPIO,"Come on, Artoo, we're going!"
LUKE,"Okay.  Han, you put these on."
VADER,You are unwise to lower your defenses.
THREEPIO,I don't like the look of this.
VADER,You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor.  Take her away!
YODA,That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain  of evil it is. In you must go.
THREEPIO,"Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?"
LUKE,Ben is a great man.
LUKE,All right.
LEIA,It's a wonder you're still alive.Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
THREEPIO,"Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication."
LEIA,You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...
HAN,I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.
YODA,Concentrate!
LUKE,I've got to go to them.
LUKE,Thanks to you.
LANDO,Here goes nothing.
LEIA,I'm not gonna hurt you.
LEIA,"Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm."
HAN,I think I got it. I got it!
THREEPIO,And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!
HAN,"Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me."
LUKE,Who is she?  She's beautiful.
LUKE,Lock the door!
THREEPIO,"Now, don't forget this!  Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!"
THREEPIO,"In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years."
HAN,What's that? I know that laugh.
VADER,"You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny."
THREEPIO,"Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!"
BEN,Destroyed... by the Empire!
HAN,Leia!
LUKE,Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
HAN,There goes our surprise attack.
BEN,It will be enough.
LANDO,Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm  the administrator of this facility. and who might you be?
LUKE,"But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her."
HAN,"Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!"
VADER,Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
HAN,What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?
VADER,"What is it, General?"
LUKE,No!
LUKE,"There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sand People all right.  I can see one of them now."
LUKE,Ow!
HAN,Chewie!  Come here!
HAN,Lando!
THREEPIO,"Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that  you..."
LUKE,Dagobah...
LUKE,Something just moves past my leg!  Look!  Did you see that?
YODA,No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.
BEN,"He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.  I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me..."
HAN,"Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!"
LEIA,Give the evacuation code signal. And get to  your transports!
LUKE,I have a very bad feeling about this.
THREEPIO,"Shutting up, sir."
THREEPIO,That isn't very reassuring.
LUKE,"Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal."
LEIA,Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
BEN,"An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire."
LEIA,I...I can't tell you.
LANDO,"Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better,  but I have my own problems."
LANDO,But what about those fighter?
THREEPIO,"Oh!  All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here.  If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance."
LEIA,All the coordinates are set. It's now or never.
BEN,"You must do what you feel is right, of course."
THREEPIO,Did you hear that?  They've shut down the main reactor.  We'll be destroyed for sure.  This is madness!
HAN,This is no cave.
HAN,Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.
THREEPIO,"Master Luke, you're standing on..."
LEIA,Yes...very friendly.
LUKE,We're going to the Dagobah system.
LUKE,"Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot  of work to do."
THREEPIO,What's that?
LEIA,They're getting closer!
LANDO,You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us  among the clouds.
LANDO,"Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the  price you pay for being successful."
BEN,They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.
LUKE,Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.
LEIA,You're going to attack them?!
HAN,"Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides,  we'll soon be gone."
HAN,"You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient."
YODA,"Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny."
THREEPIO,"Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?"
LUKE,You bet I could.  I'm not such a bad pilot myself!  We don't have to sit here and listen...
THREEPIO,Oh. No one to meet us.
THREEPIO,"Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time  to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being."
THREEPIO,"Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow!"
LANDO,"That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han  to this bounty hunter!"
LANDO,"Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?"
LEIA,Can you trust him?
HAN,"What do you mean, ""nobody knows""?"
HAN,What are you talking about?
LUKE,My scope's negative.  I don't see anything.
VADER,Bring my shuttle.
LANDO,All right. Stand by.
LUKE,I think we took a wrong turn.
LUKE,Yoda spoke of another.
VADER,If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told  you what happened to your father.
LEIA,I can't 
LUKE,The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.
VADER,Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes.
LUKE,About three or four seasons.
THREEPIO,"Of course I can, sir.  It's like a second language for me...  I'm as fluent in Bocce..."
HAN,"I've been waiting for you, Jabba."
HAN,Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any  ideas?
HAN,"Yeah, great at getting us into trouble."
LUKE,"Yes, Artoo?"
VADER,Luke.
VADER,"It is pointless to resist, my son."
LEIA,The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...
THREEPIO,Goodness gracious me!
THREEPIO,"Oh, Master Luke."
THREEPIO,Wait! Wait!
LUKE,"Yes, that's it. Dagobah."
HAN,Chewie!
LEIA,We did it!
LUKE,Artoo!
HAN,Han Solo.  I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
LUKE,Are you all right?
LUKE,"Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows.  I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure...  Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got."
LUKE,"Oh, no!"
LUKE,Well more wealth that you can imagine.
LUKE,I will. And I'll return. I promise.
THREEPIO,"Oh, no! The Rancor!"
THREEPIO,"Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!"
HAN,Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.
HAN,"Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again."
LUKE,Unfortunate that I know the truth?
HAN,It's worse.
HAN,"Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.  It ain't there.  It's been totally blown away."
LEIA,Stop that.
LUKE,But there's gotta be something you can do!
HAN,"On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?"
LUKE,"Sand People!  Or worse!  Come on, let's have a look.  Come on."
VADER,His lightsaber.
HAN,...but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built.   Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
YODA,"Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father."
LUKE,"Yes.  Rich, powerful!  Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be..."
LEIA,Anoat system. There's not much there.
VADER,"If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally."
THREEPIO,"If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive  motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!"
HAN,"Hey, what's goin' on?"
VADER,Did you find any droids?
VADER,Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for  stun.
THREEPIO,"""Exciting"" is hardly the word I would use."
HAN,"Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando."
LEIA,"Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.  Okay?"
THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir."
VADER,Obi-Wan has taught you well.
LUKE,I want to go with you.
BEN,"You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view."
BEN,Move along.
LANDO,He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called  Skywalker.
LEIA,"Outside, in the cave."
VADER,"Yes, Admiral, what is it?"
LEIA,Vader wants us all dead.
LUKE,"Ben?  Ben Kenobi!  Boy, am I glad to see you! "
HAN,"My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?"
HAN,"And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day."
THREEPIO,I...I never knew I had it in me.
VADER,I have you now.
BEN,Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?
THREEPIO,It sounds like Han.
LEIA,Good luck.
BEN,Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
LANDO,What's wrong with the Falcon?
LUKE,Great. Come on.
BEN,"Only passengers.  Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked."
LUKE,It couldn't happen here.  You said it yourself.  The Empire won't bother with this rock.
YODA,Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?
HAN,Look...
LUKE,"Han, don't. It'll be all right."
VADER,"I have felt him, my Master."
HAN,I don't have it with me.  Tell Jabba...
VADER,They must never again leave this city.
LEIA,Asteroids!
LEIA,Dantooine.
BEN,"Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view."
LEIA,What?
HAN,I have a really bad feeling about this.
LANDO,Whoa! Whoa! Help!
HAN,She expressed her true feelings for me.
HAN,And hope they don't have blasters.
THREEPIO,"And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it."
HAN,What did he say?
LEIA,I hope you know what you're doing.
VADER,Do they have a code clearance?
LEIA,And we're the bait.
LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi..."
HAN,I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.
BEN,"Wait, Luke!  It's too dangerous."
LUKE,... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.
LANDO,"Wedge, I don't think we're going to make it."
HAN,"Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping."
THREEPIO,I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a  perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...
YODA,"Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help  them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered."
LUKE,I'll see you back at the fleet.
VADER,"When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master."
HAN,Great kid!  Don't get cocky.
VADER,"That is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set  your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men."
HAN,Thank you. Thank you very much.
LUKE,I must be allowed to speak.
LUKE,"Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You  don't even know who I am.  Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time."
YODA,"Told you, did he?"
BEN,"The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?"
THREEPIO,"Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas."
LUKE,Father... I won't leave you.
LUKE,How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!
THREEPIO,"I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go."
HAN,"It could be a speeder, one of ours."
HAN,Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!
LUKE,Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!
HAN,I call it luck. 
VADER,"I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.  We meet again, at last.  The circle is now complete."
LEIA,"Han, get up here!"
LEIA,I know.
LEIA,"Come on, General, let's move."
LANDO,Watch out. Squad at .06.
THREEPIO,"Hang on, Artoo!"
LUKE,Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...
BEN,This is Chewbacca.  He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.
LEIA,Shall we try and go around?
HAN,It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
HAN,How's this?
LUKE,Rouge Three.
BEN,Turn the ship around!
LUKE,This R2 unit has a bad motivator.  Look!
HAN,"Fine. Together again, huh?"
LEIA,You're imagining things.
HAN,"Yes, Your Highnessness?"
LEIA,"No, wait.  They'll hear!"
LUKE,That's all right. I'd like to keep it  on manual control for a while.
LUKE,I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've  got to help them.
LUKE,I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
BEN,It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your  friends are made to suffer.
THREEPIO,He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
LUKE,Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner.
HAN,The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!
HAN,"What the...?  Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.  Some kind of asteroid collision.  It's not on any of the charts."
LUKE,Then you know why I have to face him.
LUKE,Got him!
LUKE,"Sure, go ahead."
BEN,"We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan."
BEN,He will learn patience.
LUKE,He told me enough! He told me you killed him.
HAN,"It is for me, sister!  Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.  I expect to be well paid.  I'm in it for the money!"
LUKE,"I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared..."
LANDO,Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point- blank range.
LUKE,"They're going to execute her.  Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay. "
BEN,That's what your uncle told you.  He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
BEN,looking for.
LUKE,"Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left."
VADER,As you wish.
LUKE,I can't shake him!
LUKE,Blast it!  Wedge where are you?
THREEPIO,"Oh, my! They'll be captured!"
LUKE,Artoo!
LEIA,Closer?
LANDO,Lord Vader.
VADER,"What is thy bidding, my master?"
LANDO,"All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed."
THREEPIO,"I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all,  he's only a Wookiee."
VADER,"Luke, help me take this mask off."
VADER,Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
THREEPIO,"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says ""I found her,"" and keepsrepeating, ""She's here."""
LUKE,Just hang on. We're almost there.
BEN,Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.
LUKE,"Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any  life readings."
HAN,I hope she's alright.
THREEPIO,Don't get technical with me.
HAN,"If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie."
HAN,"All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!"
HAN,We're coming up on the sentry ships.  Hold 'em off!  Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!
HAN,Proper?!
LEIA,Their tracking us!
THREEPIO,There it is. Listen! Listen!
HAN,Who are you?
HAN,"Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my  mind."
HAN,Watch out!
HAN,"Thank you, General."
HAN,Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
LUKE,I can't see a thing in this helmet.
VADER,The Emperor has been expecting you.
LUKE,"But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to  return and finish what I've begun. You have my word."
LUKE,Get alongside that one!
HAN,What's so important?  What's he carrying?
HAN,"Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's  forgotten about that."
YODA,"Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I , the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke...  There is... another...Sky...Sky...walker."
YODA,Hah. He is not ready.
LEIA,Let go.
HAN,Go get him!
HAN,"Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up..."
THREEPIO,He made a fair move.  Screaming about it won't help you.
LEIA,"It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him.  Lando, open the top hatch."
HAN,Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!
HAN,"There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me."
LUKE,Where... where is she?
LUKE,I won't fail you -- I'm not afraid.
LANDO,"That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational!  Home One, this is Gold Leader."
LEIA,Leia.
LUKE,I can't kill my own father.
LUKE,"Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs.  It's been so...quiet."
BEN,"Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost  Vader."
THREEPIO,"You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc."
LEIA,"Come on, let's get outta here."
THREEPIO,They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do?  We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!
LUKE,"Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic."
LEIA,No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You can't possibly...
LANDO,We're getting out of here.
LUKE,Is the ship all right?
LUKE,And you will be rewarded.
HAN,Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
HAN,"Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie.  Thank you. Okay."
HAN,"Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight!  I takeorders from one person!  Me!"
LUKE,"Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be right back."
HAN,"I use them for smuggling.  I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.  This is ridiculous.  Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam."
LEIA,They're on Dantooine.
LUKE,"Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.  We're going in.  We're going in full throttle."
LEIA,"Oh, no."
LUKE,"Oh, no!"
THREEPIO,Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know  a power socket from a computer terminal.
HAN,Come on...that's it.
LEIA,What?
THREEPIO,Here we go again.
HAN,"Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go  back a long way, Lando and me."
BEN,"Luke, trust me."
HAN,"No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with  the hyperdrive."
THREEPIO,"I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper."
HAN,I heard the command center had been hit.
LUKE,"Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home.  It's late, I'm in for it as it is."
LEIA,You got your clearance to leave.
HAN,I know.
THREEPIO,"Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate,  but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it."
LEIA,"Uh, General... count me in."
HAN,You sent Greedo to blast me.
LEIA,Put that thing away!  You're going to get us all killed.
LUKE,I'll never join you!
BEN,How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
THREEPIO,"Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field."
LEIA,I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks  it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.
HAN,The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...
HAN,That was no laser blast! Something hit us.
HAN,It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.
LUKE,Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight.
VADER,"Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want  that ship and not excuses."
HAN,Take it easy.
BEN,"Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece."
LANDO,"No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be  noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves."
LUKE,Thanks.
LANDO,This way.
HAN,"Yes, I'll bet you have."
VADER,"The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi  yet."
HAN,...I think we'd better replace the negative power  coupling.
LUKE,"Artoo, try and increase the power!"
HAN,It's not fair!
HAN,"I'm sorry, too."
VADER,Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium  Falcon?
HAN,What are you telling them?
LUKE,"Okay, let's go."
LANDO,Having trouble with you droid?
BEN,"Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough."
LEIA,Hold me.
HAN,"Who's scruffy-looking?  I must have hit her pretty close  to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?"
HAN,Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
LUKE,It looks like I'm going nowhere.  I have to finish cleaning those droids.
HAN,My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.
HAN,"Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it."
THREEPIO,Where could they be?
LANDO,Punch it!
THREEPIO,"Oh, this is suicide!"
HAN,"This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart."
LANDO,"There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East  Platform..."
BEN,Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
LEIA,Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.
HAN,Put them back together right now.
LUKE,Good...
LUKE,"Luke, what's wrong?"
LEIA,The cave is collapsing.
LEIA,I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out  here much longer.
LUKE,Keep on that one! I'll take these two!
LEIA,That's right.
LEIA,Someone who loves you.
LUKE,So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?
LEIA,Who's worried?
HAN,We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.  Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven.  You go get her.  I'll hold them here.
HAN,What?
LUKE,Leia! Leia's my sister.
LANDO,That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over  everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.
HAN,Where?
THREEPIO,"Are you there, sir?"
HAN,Luke!  Luke!
VADER,"He will join us or die, my master."
LEIA,You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.
LUKE,Just Luke.
LUKE,"Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners."
LEIA,The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
THREEPIO,We're doomed!
LUKE,"There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance."
LUKE,"You don't believe in the Force, do you?"
LUKE,What a piece of junk.
LEIA,Here they come!
LANDO,"Luke, we're ready for takeoff."
THREEPIO,"Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!"
LUKE,Anywhere!  Oh!!
LUKE,Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite  that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long.
LUKE,What's going on?
LEIA,I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
BEN,You'll have to sell your speeder.
LUKE,"I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone."
LANDO,"Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a  lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled."
HAN,"You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well,  this could be it, sweetheart."
HAN,"Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us."
LUKE,Father.
LUKE,... oh-five; we'll cover for you.
HAN,"No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying  to reach Lando Calrissian."
HAN,"All right, all right, you old smoothie."
THREEPIO,"Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!"
HAN,"Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!"
VADER,The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
LUKE,"It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!"
LEIA,That's right. Come on. Hmmm?
LEIA,Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
YODA,"Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years  have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.  This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things.  You are reckless!"
LUKE,You know him!
VADER,"That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress."
YODA,If you honor what they fight for...yes!
LUKE,"Mostly because of my father, I guess."
LUKE,"Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now!"
HAN,"Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance."
LANDO,"All right, all right, all right."
LUKE,You'll find I'm full of surprises.
LEIA,What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid  field?
HAN,How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?
HAN,Everything is under control.  Situation normal.
THREEPIO,"Might I have a word with you, please?"
HAN,Hey!
VADER,"This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze  Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor."
LUKE,"Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level, will you?  Do you copy?"
THREEPIO,Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators.  You could say...
LUKE,Where are you going?  Come back!
LUKE,"H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay."
LANDO,"They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe."
LUKE,What do you mean?  Where is it?
THREEPIO,"Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial  Star Destroyer..."
LUKE,"Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict."
HAN,"Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.  There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny."
LUKE,"Quietly, there might be more of them out there."
LUKE,But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
LANDO,I'll get my people to work on it.
HAN,That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.
THREEPIO,"Wait a minute, where are you going?"
HAN,"Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack."
LEIA,I know where Luke is.
LUKE,It's Vader.
HAN,The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're  in great shape.
LEIA,Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.
LEIA,"Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice."
LEIA,There are still two more of them out there!
LUKE,"I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs."
HAN,"Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this."
LEIA,There's something out there.
BEN,"Run, Luke!  Run!"
LUKE,No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!
HAN,"Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!"
BEN,They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you... always!
THREEPIO,"Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!"
LEIA,Quiet.
HAN,"Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right?"
LUKE,I didn't hear you give any ideas...
HAN,I don't know.  Fly casual.
LUKE,The walls are moving!
LEIA,"Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes."
THREEPIO,Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred  seventy-five...to one.
LUKE,What are you talking about?
VADER,Luke...it is your destiny.
BEN,"When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him.  I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.  I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.  I was wrong.  My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy."
LANDO,Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes  control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive.
HAN,I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
LUKE,There's something not right here.
THREEPIO,"I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the  ship.  Oh, no."
LUKE,He's my father.
VADER,What do you mean?
VADER,"What is thy bidding, my Master?"
BEN,"You can't win, Darth.  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine."
LEIA,"Come on!  Luke, its too late!"
HAN,"Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here."
VADER,Send a scanning crew on board.  I want every part of this ship checked.
LUKE,That's it!  We did it!
LUKE,"Biggs!  Of course, I'll be up there with you!  Listen, have I got some stories to tell..."
BEN,I seem to have found it.
LUKE,"Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're  making a mess. Hey, give me that!"
LUKE,"Uh, you can call me Luke."
LUKE,What is it?
LUKE,"Thanks, Wedge."
LEIA,"Okay. Easy, Chewie."
HAN,"Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind."
THREEPIO,"Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!"
LANDO,"Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very  self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny?"
LUKE,It followed us!
LUKE,"Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?"
LUKE,You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.
LUKE,We're not going to regroup with the others.
LUKE,Ben...Ben.
HAN,"Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else."
HAN,"Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?"
LEIA,Here they come!
HAN,Hyperdrive.
VADER,You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be  destroyed as Obi-Wan did.
VADER,"There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet  realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy."
BEN,"I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault."
LEIA,We've lost lateral controls.
THREEPIO,Disintegrated?
LEIA,I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.
LEIA,"She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?"
LUKE,What's wrong with him now?
LEIA,All right. You want something to eat?
LUKE,There they are!
HAN,"She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.  She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.  I've added some special modifications myself."
LEIA,They're coming through!
LUKE,I found out Darth Vader was my father.
LUKE,"Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.  We don't want any trouble."
YODA,Only what you take with you.
LUKE,What?  How?
VADER,"So, you have accepted the truth."
HAN,"Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here."
VADER,Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear...  now release your anger.
VADER,Only your hatred can destroy me.
THREEPIO,Closer?!
LUKE,I'm on my way in now...
THREEPIO,We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?
LEIA,No. Where are we?
LEIA,This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at  all.
VADER,"You have learned much, young one."
LUKE,And sacrifice Han and Leia?
LUKE,I didn't know you were back!  When did you get in?
LUKE,I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get  out of this slimy mudhole.
LEIA,What's wrong?
LEIA,"It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no  choice."
HAN,It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
THREEPIO,"What mission?  What are you talking about?  I've had just about enough of you!  Go that way!  You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!"
LEIA,Luke...We've got to go back.
HAN,I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let  something tear it apart.
BEN,"I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.She needs your help."
LUKE,"Sure, there're more than enough droids."
LUKE,"I will not fight you, father."
LUKE,"Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids."
LUKE,That oughta hold it for a while.
HAN,Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It  must have had a self-destruct.
BEN,"Luke, the Force will be with you."
THREEPIO,"I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win."
THREEPIO,"I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for."
LUKE,Vader's on that ship.
LUKE,"Okay.  Now, I'm going to put these on you."
LEIA,I don't like this.
VADER,A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
LUKE,I can't. It's too big.
LUKE,Then the droid does belong to you.
HAN,Here's the terminal.
LUKE,I only wish Ben were here.
LANDO,I had no choice...
HAN,"I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur."
LEIA,The bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
HAN,"Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!"
LEIA,Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.
LUKE,"No, my father didn't fight in the wars.  He was a navigator on a spice freighter."
HAN,That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a  gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
HAN,You're trembling.
HAN,"No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!"
HAN,"How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact,  you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark."
LUKE,You want the impossible.
LEIA,Would it helped if I got out and pushed?
LANDO,This deal's getting worse all the time.
LUKE,But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...
HAN,Never tell me the odds!
BEN,"Only a master of evil, Darth."
THREEPIO,"Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no."
LUKE,"No, I'm not going to change my mind about this.   I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there..."
HAN,"Seventeen, huh!"
HAN,"Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em."
LEIA,Evacuate remaining ground staff.
LEIA,"Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited."
THREEPIO,"Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately."
THREEPIO,I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.
HAN,Easy... you call that easy?
BEN,"Quickly, son... they're on the move."
LEIA,"You needn't worry about your reward.  If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!"
LEIA,What do you think you're doing?
HAN,"You in, kid?  Okay, stay sharp!"
LEIA,Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
LEIA,"The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers."
HAN,"Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump  their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away."
LUKE,"Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
THREEPIO,Come on!
LUKE,But I've learned so much.
LUKE,That armor's too strong for blasters.
LUKE,Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?
THREEPIO,"Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?"
HAN,"All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give  you a hand."
LUKE,Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
THREEPIO,"Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not  right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough..."
LUKE,I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.
HAN,It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!
LUKE,"Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo."
LUKE,"Just like new, Dack. How about you?"
HAN,Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
LUKE,"Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.  They could use a good pilot like you.  You're turning your back on them."
THREEPIO,"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir."
BEN,You can't win.  But there are alternatives to fighting.
LEIA,"Chewie, just do it."
THREEPIO,Your Royal Highness.
THREEPIO,"Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh -- Take this off! I, uh, don't mean  to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No!"
THREEPIO,"Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?"
BEN,He can go about his business.
LUKE,"Steady, Rouge Two"
LUKE,There isn't any other way out.
BEN,Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid.
LUKE,Artoo! Where are you?
HAN,Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about  me.
THREEPIO,"Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!  Now come out before somebody sees you."
THREEPIO,At last!  Where have you been?
THREEPIO,"Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened  to me!"
THREEPIO,"Well, uh, you see..."
THREEPIO,"Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, You'd probably short-circuit."
LUKE,"You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now."
THREEPIO,You watch your language!
HAN,Ahhh...
LUKE,Hello.
LUKE,I will.
THREEPIO,"Well, really!"
LUKE,You fought in the Clone Wars?
LUKE,Why didn't you say so before?
HAN,Princess?
LEIA,"Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it."
HAN,"Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you."
LUKE,"Oh, Leia."
HAN,"Come here, you big coward!"
LEIA,You're who?
VADER,If that is your destiny.
LUKE,"Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going."
THREEPIO,We're coming!
LUKE,"All right, I'm coming in."
LANDO,You're being put into carbon freeze.
LUKE,"Oh, Artoo, let him have it."
LANDO,"No, wait! I thought you were blind!"
THREEPIO,"Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely  stable."
LUKE,"Thank you, sir.  I'll try."
LUKE,Yoda...
LEIA,No!
THREEPIO,"Oh, no!"
LUKE,Wait a minute!
BEN,"You see, you can do it."
THREEPIO,"What are you talking about? We're not interested in the  hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump."
BEN,"There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there.  You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire."
HAN,"If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here."
LEIA,Oh!
LUKE,What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?  Come on!
THREEPIO,We're doomed.
THREEPIO,"Turn around, you wooly...!  Hurry, hurry! We're  trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!"
LUKE,"I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master."
THREEPIO,Nobody knows where he is.
LEIA,What's he saying?
LUKE,Dack? Dack!
VADER,"Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen."
HAN,I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.
HAN,Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
LEIA,The code's changed. We need Artoo!
LUKE,Aaargh!
LANDO,Fighters coming in.
THREEPIO,We're doomed.
LUKE,Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?
LUKE,I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
LANDO,"You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the  fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy."
LUKE,What's that flashing?
LUKE,We're right above you.  Stand by.
LEIA,Chewie.
LEIA,We ran into some old friends.
BEN,"Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke...but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience.  Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared."
HAN,It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
THREEPIO,"I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor."
LANDO,"Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If  you put him in there, it might kill him."
HAN,Boring conversation anyway.Luke!  We're going to have company!
THREEPIO,"Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!"
LEIA,Lando system?
VADER,"You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett."
HAN,"No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right?"
THREEPIO,"Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our  only hope."
HAN,Luke!
HAN,"Great shot, kid.  That was one in a million."
THREEPIO,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion..."
LANDO,"When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty  hunter, we'll contact you."
LUKE,You mean it controls your actions?
HAN,No time to discuss this as a committee.
HAN,Ahh...repairs. I thought you could  help me out.
LUKE,"Not on your life!  That little droid and I have been through a lot together.You okay, Artoo?"
LUKE,Watch yourself!  Increase speed full throttle!
LUKE,"Watch that cross fire, boys."
LEIA,Over there! Two more of them!
LUKE,"All right.  Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?"
BEN,"She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke ... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!"
LUKE,No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you.
BEN,Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.  Very interesting... 
YODA,Now...the stone. Feel it.
LANDO,Pull up! All craft pull up!
LEIA,Saw what?
THREEPIO,"Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!"
VADER,"No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to  sweep the asteroid field until they are found."
LEIA,"You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them."
VADER,"The Emperor will see me, now!"
HAN,"A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur."
HAN,"Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle."
HAN,Where? Found him in a junk pile?
VADER,"I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am."
HAN,Get back to the ship!
LEIA,"Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here is."
LEIA,Ugh!
HAN,"Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a  little while longer."
LEIA,"No, thanks."
LANDO,But what about Vader?
THREEPIO,"The message, Artoo, the message."
LEIA,"Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?"
HAN,"I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip.  Okay, hit it!"
YODA,No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn  what you have learned.
LEIA,What happened?
YODA,"Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm?  Mmmm."
VADER,The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
LEIA,"Hey, I knew there was more to you than money."
HAN,"Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help."
THREEPIO,"That malfunctioning little twerp.  This is all his fault!  He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better."
HAN,"Charges!  Come on, come on!"
HAN,See?
THREEPIO,"Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far.  No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?"
THREEPIO,"Oh, he says it's nothing, sir.  Merely a malfunction.  Old data.  Pay it no mind."
HAN,"Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the  Hut, I'm a dead man."
HAN,There's an awful lot of moisture in here.
LUKE,"Hey, easy with those..."
LUKE,"There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know."
LUKE,Shape it up you guys!...  Biggs?
THREEPIO,"Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No,  no, please don't get up. No!"
THREEPIO,"Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include  shutting me down, too?"
THREEPIO,"Lock the door, Artoo."
THREEPIO,What is what?!?  He asked you a question...What is that?
VADER,I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...
BEN,Should I have?
LUKE,Not likely!  I had to cancel my application.  There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.
LUKE,That's okay.  I'm never coming back to this planet again.
BEN,I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened.
LANDO,Hold it! Whoa!
LUKE,"Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from."
THREEPIO,"No, I don't think he likes you at all."
VADER,I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.
HAN,"Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody."
THREEPIO,"Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the  others. Oh, no! I've been shot!"
THREEPIO,"Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!"
VADER,You found something?
LEIA,And what precisely am I supposed to know?
LUKE,"... so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail.  I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.  Uncle Owen was pretty upset.  He grounded me for the rest of the season.  You should have been there... it was fantastic."
HAN,I saw them! I saw them!
BEN,Stretch out with your feelings.
THREEPIO,"You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?"
THREEPIO,"Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia.  Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger."
LEIA,I'll cover you.
HAN,No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.
LUKE,What are you doing hiding there?
LUKE,Ben?
THREEPIO,"Hey, you're not permitted in there.  It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.."
LUKE,We got separated.
THREEPIO,"Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories.  Well, not at making them interesting, anyways."
HAN,I thought she was with you.
LUKE,Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.
LEIA,Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
LUKE,I will not fight you.
LUKE,"Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. "
LEIA,We don't need any of your help.
THREEPIO,"With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all."
HAN,I love you.
VADER,Leave that to me.  Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!
LUKE,"I see them. Wait, Leia!"
HAN,"I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there."
LUKE,Get him!
LEIA,I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.
THREEPIO,"Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault."
LEIA,Thanks.
HAN,"That's two you owe me, junior."
VADER,I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.
LEIA,We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...
LUKE,Wouldn't miss it.
LEIA,Then I'm going with you.
THREEPIO,"I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of  course, I've looked better."
LUKE,Got him!  I got him!
HAN,"Transport, this is Solo. Better take off -- I  can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon."
LANDO,That was too close.
HAN,That's right. And my friends out in it.
THREEPIO,Oooh!
HAN,I've got a very bad feeling about this.
LUKE,No sign of any... wait!
LUKE,"Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally  different."
YODA,"Unexpected this is, and unfortunate.."
LUKE,There you go.
LUKE,"Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?"
VADER,"Well, Calrissian, did he survive?"
HAN,Good morning. Nice of you guys to  drop by.
LEIA,"This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?"
HAN,Yeah.
LEIA,"Somebody has to save our skins.  Into the garbage chute, wise guy."
THREEPIO,Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...
LEIA,Cut it out!
VADER,If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador?
THREEPIO,"I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault."
LUKE,"Ben...Ben, please!"
HAN,"It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here."
THREEPIO,No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry!
LEIA,What?
THREEPIO,Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.
LANDO,"So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into  the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire."
HAN,"Yeah, but this time I got the money."
HAN,I'm sorry.
LUKE,You worry about those fighters!  I'll worry about the tower!
LUKE,Threepio!
THREEPIO,"Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile."
HAN,Can't get out that way.
VADER,He is here...
LANDO,Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you.
BEN,"Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.  And where you come from."
HAN,"Uh, uh, negative, negative.  We had a reactor leak here now.  Give us a few minutes to lock it down.  Large leak... very dangerous."
HAN,Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
THREEPIO,"Oh, I told you it was dangerous here."
HAN,Better her than me...
LUKE,"Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?"
THREEPIO,Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty- five thousand.
HAN,"Good, I hate long waits."
HAN,"Chewie? Chewie, is that you?"
LUKE,Look who's talking.  Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...
THREEPIO,Level five. Detention block AA-twenty-three.  I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
BEN,You cannot escape your destiny.
VADER,"Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take  the princess and the Wookiee to my ship."
THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain."
BEN,"If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot  interfere."
LUKE,I'm sorry.  I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am.  You can barely hear me...
LANDO,"How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! I  never thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?"
LUKE,Uncle Owen!  Aunt Beru!  Uncle Owen!
LEIA,Mynocks?
LUKE,It's not impossible.  I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.  They're not much bigger than two meters.
THREEPIO,"The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know  better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!"
THREEPIO,"Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either.  You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here."
THREEPIO,Oh! Wait for me!
LANDO,"We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming."
LUKE,"I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father."
HAN,"You. Listen to you -- you sound like a businessman, a responsible  leader. Who'd have thought that, huh?"
LANDO,Only the fighters are attacking.  I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for.
THREEPIO,Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.
LUKE,"I thought he might have meant Ben.  Do you know what he's talking about?  Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben."
LEIA,You don't have to do this to impress me.
THREEPIO,What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!
LUKE,"There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a  new course."
BEN,"If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well."
LANDO,"Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time."
BEN,It's an Imperial fighter.
LEIA,Occasionally  maybe...when you aren't  acting like a scoundrel.
HAN,"Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault."
HAN,Get behind me!  Get behind me!
BEN,Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
HAN,"It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check  it out."
THREEPIO,"Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?  Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand."
HAN,"Chewie, get us out of here!"
LUKE,Get the gun! Point it at the deck!
VADER,"Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will."
VADER,They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.  She may yet be of some use to us.
HAN,"Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it  off! Turn it off! Off!"
BEN,"And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise."
VADER,Close up formation.
LUKE,"Red Leader, we're right above you.  Turn to point..."
LUKE,"Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year."
LUKE,You know him?
LUKE,"No, he's not going to try anything."
LUKE,"Well, I'm sorry."
LUKE,"You, too."
THREEPIO,They aren't here!  Something must have happened to them.  See if they've been captured.
THREEPIO,Look!
BEN,"There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed  me."
THREEPIO,"Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand?  And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear."
VADER,There is no conflict.
LUKE,"Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!"
THREEPIO,"My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?"
BEN,"Well of course, of course I know him.  He's me!  I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born."
HAN,"Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines."
BEN,That boy is our last hope.
HAN,"What, Chewie? What? Chewie!"
HAN,"No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando."
YODA,You must not go!
HAN,Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.
THREEPIO,I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.
LEIA,So you're part of the mining guild then?
HAN,That's your imagination.
LEIA,The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen  or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.
LEIA,Ben Kenobi is here!  Where is he?
HAN,"Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.  We're fine.  We're all fine here, now, thank you.  How are you?"
HAN,"Sure, Leia."
LUKE,"Well, let's get moving!"
HAN,"Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?  You know, sometimes I even amaze myself."
VADER,"Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be  true."
HAN,Where?
BEN,"Don't worry, he'll be all right."
HAN,"Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure."
THREEPIO,"Oh, my!  Artoo!  Can you hear me?  Say something!You can repair him, can't you?"
LEIA,I don't know.
LUKE,Yes. It's you Leia.
HAN,"All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!"
LANDO,What?
THREEPIO,We've had some problems...
HAN,Seventeen thousand!  Those guys must really be desperate.  This could really save my neck.  Get back to the ship and get her ready.
LUKE,"Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we  can't see Yoda now."
HAN,Why not?
VADER,"She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.  Send a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally, Commander.  There'll be no one to stop us this time."
HAN,I can't hold them off forever!  Now what?
LEIA,"Just...images, really. Feelings."
LUKE,Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
LUKE,"Father, please. Help me."
THREEPIO,"Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet!  You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur!"
THREEPIO,Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
LUKE,Dagobah system...
LUKE,"Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate."
VADER,You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
LUKE,You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.
VADER,This will be a day long remembered.  It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.
LANDO,"Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!"
THREEPIO,"Ohhh, I can't bear to watch."
HAN,"Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey!"
VADER,Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.  The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
HAN,"Well, look at you, a general, huh?"
THREEPIO,"Excuse us, please."
LEIA,You certainly have a way with people.
BEN,That's your uncle talking.
THREEPIO,"That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here."
LANDO,Break off the attack! The shield is still up.
LUKE,Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!
LUKE,Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
LEIA,Are you crazy?!
THREEPIO,"Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security  system."
LEIA,Yes.
LUKE,Han!
THREEPIO,"That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir."
HAN,Hey!  Hey!
THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?"
LUKE,And that is why I have to go.
LUKE,"Oh, no. We'll never get it out now."
VADER,He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
HAN,"Well, what would you like?"
LANDO,"All right, Chewie. Let's go."
LEIA,What about Han?
LUKE,But he can...
BEN,"So was I, if you'll remember."
LUKE,There's still good in him.
LUKE,"Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going."
LUKE,You won't.
VADER,What?
LEIA,I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
LUKE,"Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in."
LUKE,"Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner.  It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator."
YODA,Use the Force. Yes...
LANDO,"Everyone's invited, of course."
THREEPIO,How did I get into this mess?  I really don't know how.  We seem to be made to suffer.  It's our lot in life.
HAN,Here's where the fun begins!
LEIA,He's got to follow his own path.  No one can choose it for him.
LUKE,Why don't you outrun them?  I thought you said this thing was fast.
LUKE,How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?
LEIA,Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.
BEN,Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
HAN,Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you  have to take care of her. You hear me?
LEIA,Not really.
LEIA,With the rest of the garbage. Then what?
BEN,"The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate."
LUKE,"Blast it, will you!  My gun's jammed."
HAN,Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?
HAN,"Yeah, you're a real hero."
LUKE,"Yeah, take it away."
HAN,Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?
HAN,Be careful.
HAN,"Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?"
THREEPIO,"Sir, sir! Might I suggest..."
HAN,Then I'll see you in hell!
LUKE,Artoo -- that way!
LUKE,"All right, boys, keep tight now."
LEIA,"Quick, we've got to get across.  Find the control that extends the bridge."
THREEPIO,"And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo."
YODA,"Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure  at the cave!"
LUKE,Come on!
HAN,Where are you going?
HAN,Over to you?
THREEPIO,"Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this."
HAN,"Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!"
LUKE,But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
LEIA,"Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this."
LEIA,"That doesn't sound too hard.  Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape."
VADER,Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
HAN,Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
THREEPIO,"Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump."
HAN,What do you want?
HAN,Turn her around.
HAN,"Don't worry, she'll hold together."
LUKE,Red Five standing by.
LANDO,All wings report in.
LUKE,"Hobbie, you still with me?"
VADER,Escape may not his plan.  I must face him alone.
HAN,We're in trouble!
YODA,Luke! You must complete the training.
LUKE,"The Academy didn't change you much... but you're back so soon?  Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?"
LEIA,I'll be back.
HAN,"We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here."
HAN,"You, too."
LUKE,Will you forget it?  I already tried it.  It's magnetically sealed!
LANDO,Lower it!
HAN,"Still, she's got a lot of spirit.  I don't know, what do you think?  Do you think a princess and a guy like me..."
LUKE,Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.
HAN,It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out  there.
HAN,"Boy you said it, Chewie."
HAN,Luke?
LUKE,You serve your master well.
